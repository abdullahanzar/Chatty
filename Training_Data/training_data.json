        "content": "My husband (30m) is a picky eater and by picky I mean doesn’t eat vegetables except potatoes, no fruit. No sauces except for barbecue sauce on certain things. If he could he would eat only meat and potatoes which is fine except I am the one doing the cooking. He loves tacos, steak, cheeseburgers, pizza but it’s getting increasingly hard to cook for him without altering my meal to his taste or cooking him a seperate dinner. If I say screw it and make something I like, he will land up only picking at it and not even finish it. The issue I truly have is I don’t want our child picking up his habits and since our child is young I want him trying new things for dinner. I’m just wondering what I should say and do/compromise. Any suggestions are appreciated"

        "content": "The best example one can set for a child is to learn to respect that people are different. Preferences are okay. And preferences can have consequences: your husband going to bed hungry due to not eating dinner for instance. It's a good life lesson playing out. Kids don't turn out a certain way because they've only seen that exact thing modeled for them. In fact, if pushed too strongly, it's more likely they will desire to do the opposite. As for your husband, you need to talk to him about your concerns and feelings. Talking to him may help you arrive at a compromise."

Yes, I also thought that maybe one day, if there was an opportunity, we would try a relationship... Like in the far future. But I wanted to give my marriage a fair shot and so maybe it's for the best. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed and I don't think I will reach out again, but I am so devistated they will no longer in my life. I think maybe if I left my partner when they first confessed their feelings, they wouldn't have pushed me away. But I saw them as more then just a potential love interest, and thought we'd be friends. How do I let go?"

They have been asking you to talk about a lot of personal and intimate information, they know you on a very deep level and they have used their professional knowledge to help you navigate your life. Do you know this person on such an intimate level? Have they opened up about their deepest darkest secrets? I would assume no if they are a decent therapist at all.They are most likely fulfilling a need that hasn't been fulfilled. If you have marriage issues and you feel like your partner doesn't care about you but the therapist does, then it's easy to think of your therapist as a partner who will fulfill that need. But they won't treat you the same when you are together and when you are the client. By actively reminding yourself that they need to be professional, you can start to let it go."

        "content": "The last couple months have been extremely hard. My mom is gonna have a surgery on an aneurysm and the prognosis isn't good. There's a chance she could be paralyzed from the waist down. Then they found out it's also a main artery going to her brain. So if it bursts or anything goes wrong during the surgery then she dies. On top of that, there's a very high risk for a stroke which would then provoke one or both of the other two scenarios. It's been tough trying to process all of this. Then on October 19th, we lost our 17 year old Chihuahua Roxy. Heartbreaking for sure, but we were prepared. We were not prepared for what came next. October 26th, we lost our Belgian Malinois Nova to undiagnosed high grade lymphoma in her small intestines. She was only 4 years old. She was my baby. I was there when she was born, and I held her in my arms as she took her last breath. Then to top it all off, I just found out that I've been getting cheated on. A girl that I really wanted to build a future with. A girl that I completely and utterly was in love with. We talked about marriage and kids. I'm falling apart faster than I can pick up the pieces. She was completely unsupportive of my dog passing away. Dismissed it and made it feel worthless that I was mourning her. It seemed odd to me that the person you love most isn't there for you at all. Now I know. It's just hard. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to seek professional help, but I just needed to vent. I want to break down. I want to crawl in a hole and close my eyes and never wake up. What did I do to deserve this?"

Sometimes those bad things happen in clusters, and it feels like there must be some meaning to it. I'm sorry that you're going through all this. It can be a lot, sometimes too much to handle. Step one is letting go of shitty people like your ex-girlfriend. Find people who care, and let them inside. Anyone who makes you feel belittled for grief at losing a pet has no place in your life. Step two is to invite people in who you think you can trust. Allow yourself the space to grieve these animals. Most of the hardest days of my life have been when I lost cats. Don't let anyone make you feel like that's not real grief. With your mom: it’s a cliche, but you’ve got to just take it one day at a time. You could try aerobic exercise if you feel like the stress is rough on your body. It can help counteract anxiety. Mindfulness meditation could be helpful if your thoughts feel overwhelming. Try not to catastrophize, if you find yourself pulled towards that tendency. It’s good to confront the possibilities realistically, but if you experience them as intrusive thoughts, a cognitive understanding of catastrophizing and the practice of mindfulness may help you to disengage from anxiety indicting processes."

Probably because I never keep a friend for long. I have a hard time with constant anxiety that the friend doesn't like me or isn't even my friend but actually just being nice because they are good people. It makes me depressed and I think about going bye bye whenever I don't get reassurance constantly that they love me. If they talk to other people I get jealous. If they don't talk to me for a few days I think about going bye bye. It is deeply distressing but I can't help it. Why do I do this and how can I cure the fear?"

Many people lose friends due to lack of similar interests and it's completely normal to have a few friends fade out naturally. In life, people leaving is inevitable, but it's generally best for them to leave because if they stayed around it wouldn't be a genuine relationship. Try having more confidence in your friendships and if they don't reciprocate the trust you give them, it's their own problem. In the long run it's for the best, because then you will have an extremely supportive social circle with people you can confidently say will stay by your side."
